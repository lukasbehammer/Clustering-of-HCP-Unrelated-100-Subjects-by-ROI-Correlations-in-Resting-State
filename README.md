# Clustering of HCP Unrelated 100 Subjects by ROI-Correlations in Resting State

This is a Work In Progress (WIP) project. It is part of my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering at
Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule in Germany. This repository incorporates the code and results of my participation
in the course Data Science Projects: Train you own Machine Learning Model. The goal of this project is to demonstrate
that clustering of Resting State fMRI data to distinguish between different gender of subjects. This should pave the
way for a future diagnosis of different diseases that are connected to reorganisation of the human brain.
